## About - What is a Figlet?

A Figlet is a text based way to add large block text to your code or chats.  There are a variety of "Fonts" available that you'll find listed along the left side of the screen.

## To use in your code

The easiest way to is make a multiline string in your code using triple quotes:

```python

'''
This is a multiline string
Line 2
'''
```


You can simply paste your Figlet into one of these multiline comments.  They work well at breaking up your code into chunks

```python

'''
                    oo          
                                
88d8b.d8b. .d8888b. dP 88d888b. 
88'`88'`88 88'  `88 88 88'  `88 
88  88  88 88.  .88 88 88    88 
dP  dP  dP `88888P8 dP dP    dP
'''

def main():
    x = 20
